        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I’m a 24‑year‑old Arab coach who’s obsessed with improving people’s lives. I’ve always loved getting into the nitty‑gritty of training and nutrition, because that’s where true progress happens. My passion for coaching comes from seeing others grow — I’m constantly pushing myself to be better every day, and I want you to experience that same boost in confidence and capability.</p>
