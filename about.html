        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I’m a 19‑year‑old dedicated coach who’s obsessed with improving people’s lives. I’ve always loved getting into the nitty‑gritty of training and nutrition, because that’s where true progress happens.  My passion for coaching comes from seeing others grow — I’m constantly pushing myself to be better every day, and I want you to experience that same boost in confidence and capability.</p>
        <p>I keep my monthly prices reasonable because what matters most to me is your transformation.  When you join PowerPlay Fitness, you’re not just buying a plan; you’re teaming up with someone who genuinely cares about your success and will challenge you to reach your potential.</p>
        <p>Our platform leverages cutting‑edge technology, including interactive workouts and AI‑driven coaching, to deliver a training experience that is engaging, effective and sustainable. According to research, the wellness market has grown into a <strong>US$4.5 trillion industry</strong>【366072409133338†L138-L141】, and the e‑learning market is projected to reach <strong>US$319.16 billion by 2025</strong>【366072409133338†L224-L227】. We sit at the intersection of these growing sectors, offering a unique service that empowers you to learn, grow and train in an immersive, gamified environment.</p>
        <p>We’re more than just a fitness program – we’re a community. Through team challenges, co‑operative quests and collaborative leaderboards, you’ll forge friendships and rivalries that motivate you to push harder and achieve more.</p>
