        <p>Our membership tiers are designed to give you maximum value and flexibility. Whether you’re just starting your fitness journey or seeking the ultimate level‑up, there’s a plan for you.</p>

This tier gives you personalized routines, macro‑balanced meal plans, progress tracking and community support. It's perfect if you're ready to stop guessing and start training with a science‑backed plan. Accountability ensures you stay on track: skip a workout or ignore a nutrition guideline and you’ll face a Penalty Quest—like an extra 15‑minute HIIT session or a small charity donation—to keep you committed.</p>
