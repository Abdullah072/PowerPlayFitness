                <p class="plan-desc">Kick‑start your journey with a plan engineered to build powerful habits and momentum. This tier rewires your daily routine and mindset by combining AI‑personalized workouts with macro‑balanced meal plans and weekly progress checkpoints. You’ll feel a steady stream of wins, building confidence from the inside out. To ensure you never stall out, you'll agree to our Penalty Quests—fun, gamified consequences like a bonus 15‑minute HIIT session or a small charity donation when you miss a workout or ignore the plan. It’s designed for those ready to stop guessing and start transforming, one rep at a time.</p>
